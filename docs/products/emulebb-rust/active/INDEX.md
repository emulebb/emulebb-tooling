# emulebb-rust Active Backlog — Issue Index

This directory is the active local backlog/spec layer for the **emulebb-rust**
headless client. It follows the eMuleBB backlog convention
([`BACKLOG-PROCESS`](../../../reference/BACKLOG-PROCESS.md),
[`BACKLOG-ITEM-TEMPLATE`](../../../reference/BACKLOG-ITEM-TEMPLATE.md)):
each item is `docs/active/items/<ID>.md` with the same front matter and section
vocabulary.

Most active product items are **GitHub-tracked** (`workflow: github`): issues
live in `emulebb/emulebb-rust` and are aggregated on the org **eMuleBB Suite**
board (`https://github.com/orgs/emulebb/projects/3`, `Product = emulebb-rust`,
`Phase` field). GitHub owns workflow state (status, priority, placement); these
Markdown files own the durable engineering spec. Local-only backlog items record
internal evidence gates, CI debt, or closure decisions that do not need public
workflow state. Parked ideas stay out of the tracker entirely (see the roadmap's
Active vs Parked ledger).

## Current Snapshot

**Source of truth:** code in `EMULEBB_WORKSPACE_ROOT\repos\emulebb-rust`
(`main` branch); active docs in
`EMULEBB_WORKSPACE_ROOT\repos\emulebb-tooling\docs\products\emulebb-rust`.
**Scope note:** emulebb-rust is **out of RC2 ship scope** (the emulebb-mfc RC train).
Since 2026-07-05 the repo carries its **own release gate**: the
`rust-v0.1.0-beta.1` first-usable-release program tracked by
[RUST-FEAT-033](items/RUST-FEAT-033.md) (`milestone: release-0.1.0-beta.1`
groups its items).
**Protocol policy:** IPv4-only, stock eMule wire-compatible for implemented
eD2K/Kad behaviour. SX1 is the only pre-approved permanent protocol drop; the
current omission registry is under re-audit. Machine-readable omissions remain
in `EMULEBB_WORKSPACE_ROOT\repos\emulebb-rust\policy\rust-client-omissions.toml`.
**Design sketches:** [`architecture`](../design/architecture.md).
**Backlog process runbook:**
[`BACKLOG-PROCESS`](../../../reference/BACKLOG-PROCESS.md)

## ID Taxonomy

Item IDs carry a **product prefix** so they never collide across the suite repos:
emulebb-rust uses `RUST-<CLASS>-<NNN>` with classes `BUG`, `FEAT`, `REF`, `CI`
(e.g. `RUST-FEAT-002`). Other products use `QBBB-`, `GOED2K-`, `AMUT-`; the frozen
emulebb-mfc keeps its legacy unprefixed IDs. IDs are allocated per class and never
reused. Scan both `docs/active/items` and `docs/history/items` before
allocating the next number.

## First Beta — Rust Console UI

The first forward milestone is a Rust Console UI beta. emulebb-rust and
TrackMuleBB move in parallel, but release waits for both core proof and UI proof.
The beta targets Rust only and uses polling against the Rust-forward OpenAPI
contract in this tooling docs tree.

Core gates remain first-class: stock-wire parity, fail-closed VPN proof,
responsive REST, upload/download/search/share evidence, and soak evidence.
Indexer/Torznab/Arr work stays active forward scope but is not the first UI beta
gate unless separately promoted.

## Phase 0 — "perfectly functional" gate

emulebb-rust is the strategic forward eD2K/Kad core. "Perfectly functional" =
client parity **plus** the indexer role, per
`emulebb-tooling/docs/active/SUITE-JOINT-ROADMAP.md`. The FEAT items below are the
Phase 0 scope. Cooperative-DHT / BEP-46 publishing and similar ideas are **parked**
(see the roadmap's Active vs Parked ledger) and are intentionally **not** backlog
items.

## Core Parity Closure

Core parity closure is narrower than full Phase 0. It covers core client
behavior, Rust REST contract conformance, deterministic local cross-client interop,
and an optional public hide.me smoke witness. It does not close the Phase 0
indexer, Arr/Torznab, Docker, SSE, or automated tunnel-down leak-test work. The
closure gate and test-rationalization plan are tracked by
[RUST-CI-002](items/RUST-CI-002.md).

## Active Backlog

Only **in-progress / open** items live in `items/`. Items move to
[`../history/items/`](../history/items/INDEX.md) when they reach `DONE`, so these tables
stay active-only; see [Closed Items](#closed-items-archive) for the archive.

## Closed Items (archive)

Closed items keep their full engineering record under
[`../history/items/`](../history/items/INDEX.md). As of 2026-06-26 the archive holds the
DONE set: `RUST-FEAT-003`, `RUST-REF-001`, `RUST-CI-001`, and the
`RUST-BUG-002`…`RUST-BUG-099` parity wave. Browse that directory for the
per-item detail; this index intentionally does not re-list closed items.
