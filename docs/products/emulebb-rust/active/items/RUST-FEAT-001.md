# RUST-FEAT-001 - eD2K — Implement client UDP source reask and queue-slot persistence

## Summary

The eD2K client↔client UDP reask family (`OP_REASKFILEPING` 0x90, `OP_REASKACK`
0x91, `OP_FILENOTFOUND` 0x92, `OP_QUEUEFULL` 0x93, and the LowID variants
`OP_REASKCALLBACKUDP` 0x94 / `OP_DIRECTCALLBACKREQ` 0x95) is implemented and
enabled by default in emulebb-rust. This item remains open until the live
interoperability proof is refreshed after the latest parity fixes. Full design:
[`docs/design/udp-source-reask.md`](../../design/udp-source-reask.md).

## Current State

**Update 2026-06-14 — code-complete off by default.** The pure + state + loop
layers were implemented behind `enable_udp_reask` (off): codec/policy/registry/
state, the shared-Kad-UDP-port transport, uploader reciprocity, downloader detach,
and TCP-fallback re-engage (~64 tests, clippy-clean). The temporary omission was
recorded in `policy/rust-client-omissions.toml` while the feature was staged.

**Update 2026-06-17 — enabled by default; metadata hardening in progress.** Kad
source conversion now preserves non-zero `FT_SOURCEUPORT` for HighID as well as
firewalled-buddy sources, so UDP-reask reachability metadata is not lost before a
TCP hello can refresh it. Remaining work is live interoperability validation and
closing any defects found during that validation.

**Parity closure note 2026-06-19.** This item is no longer a broad
implementation blocker for core MFC parity. The remaining blocker is evidence:
regenerate the overnight/local parity campaign after the latest parity fixes and
run the targeted Rust/eMuleBB UDP reask proof owned by `RUST-CI-002`.

- `crates/emulebb-ed2k/src/ed2k_client_udp/` owns the client UDP reask codec,
  dispatch, obfuscation, source set, reciprocity, buddy relay, and runtime.
- `crates/emulebb-ed2k/src/config.rs` defaults `enable_udp_reask` to true.
- `crates/emulebb-core/src/lib.rs` spawns the reask loop while connected and
  wires detach/re-engage events back into transfer scheduling.
- `policy/rust-client-omissions.toml` no longer records UDP reask as an active
  omission.

## Why This Matters

UDP reask is the backbone of eMule's queue economy. On a busy swarm, uploaders
reclaim idle TCP sockets, so a held-TCP queued model loses the slot as soon as
the connection drops. The remaining risk is not the implementation itself; it is
whether the refreshed evidence proves Rust keeps MFC-compatible queue behavior
across Rust↔Rust, Rust↔eMuleBB, Rust↔aMule, and public smoke scenarios.

## Representative Sites

- `crates/emulebb-ed2k/src/ed2k_client_udp/` — UDP source reask transport,
  codec, runtime, source set, outbound framing, reciprocity, and buddy relay.
- `crates/emulebb-ed2k/src/ed2k_tcp/download/session/reask_detach.rs` — queued
  source detach eligibility.
- `crates/emulebb-core/src/lib.rs` — reask loop spawn, detach/re-engage event
  wiring, and direct-download scheduling integration.
- `crates/emulebb-ed2k/src/ed2k_tcp/listener/session/upload_queue.rs` and
  `crates/emulebb-ed2k/src/ed2k_transfer/reask_reciprocity.rs` — upload queue
  state used to answer inbound reasks.
- Reference (stock): `emulebb-main/srchybrid/DownloadClient.cpp`
  (`UDPReaskForDownload`, `UDPReaskACK`, `UDPReaskFNF`),
  `ClientUDPSocket.cpp` (reask receive/answer), `opcodes.h`
  (`FILEREASKTIME` 29 min, `MIN_REQUESTTIME` 10 min, `UDPMAXQUEUETIME` 20 s).

## Intended Shape

Per the design doc: add one shared **client UDP transport** module
(`ed2k_client_udp/`) that owns the recv loop, de-obfuscates, dispatches the
`OP_EMULEPROT` reask opcodes, and fans replies back to the owning transfer/source
by `(peer_ip, peer_udp_port)` correlation under a `pending` anti-spoof gate. Each
download transfer drives its **own** reask ticker (no global scheduler — honours
the independent per-transfer-task download model); UDP-eligible queued sources
release their TCP socket and keep position by datagram, with TCP reconnect-reask
as the bounded fallback. Implement both downloader and uploader (reciprocity)
sides with exact stock framing (`udp_version`-gated partstatus/complete-count
tails) and stock obfuscation choice. Phase the LowID buddy reask
(`OP_REASKCALLBACKUDP`) and `OP_DIRECTCALLBACKREQ` separately.

## Scope Constraints

- **Out of RC2 scope** — capture and stage; do not build under the freeze.
- IPv4-only; reuse existing obfuscation primitives; new modules within the
  `policy/rust-client.toml` size budget; no big-refactor of legacy `.rs` files.
- Phase 1 = HighID UDP reask + TCP fallback + reciprocity. Phase 2 = LowID buddy
  reask + direct callback.
- Non-goal: A4AF cross-file source dedup (separate parked design); the two
  compose but neither requires the other.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **Phase 0:** omission reconciled: UDP reask is no longer recorded as an
      active omission and advertised `udp_version` matches implemented support.
- [x] Client UDP transport module bound to the local eD2K UDP port, with
      obfuscated + plaintext recv/send and opcode dispatch keyed on
      socket + protocol byte.
- [x] Downloader sends `OP_REASKFILEPING` with stock-exact framing (hash16 +
      `udp_version`-gated partstatus + complete-count) only when UDP-eligible
      (peer UDP port + version, not firewalled, no live TCP, no proxy).
- [x] Downloader handles `OP_REASKACK` (rank + optional partstatus),
      `OP_QUEUEFULL` (rank 0, stay), `OP_FILENOTFOUND` (drop source); unsolicited
      replies dropped by the `pending` gate.
- [x] UDP-eligible queued sources release the TCP socket and retain queue
      position across TCP teardown via UDP reask on a `FILEREASKTIME`-based
      cadence (×2 NNP, `≥ MIN_REQUESTTIME`), with failure-ratio backoff to TCP.
- [x] Non-UDP-eligible sources fall back to bounded TCP reconnect-reask.
- [x] Uploader answers well-formed inbound `OP_REASKFILEPING` from known waiting
      clients with a correct queue position (silent/`OP_QUEUEFULL` per stock
      rules otherwise).
- [x] Per-transfer reask cadence introduces **no** cross-transfer shared
      scheduler.
- [ ] Refreshed live interoperability evidence proves the implemented behavior
      against the current post-`RUST-BUG-099` parity baseline.

## Validation

- Unit: per-opcode encode/decode round-trips incl. `udp_version > 2`/`> 3`
  tails; pending-gate drop; backoff threshold; reask-interval math.
- Rust↔Rust: queued downloader releases TCP and keeps position purely via UDP
  reask across an accelerated cadence.
- Rust↔aMule / Rust↔eMuleBB short-path witness (gentle, widely-spaced,
  single-pass; confirm before any live-wire run per live-wire policy).
- packet_trace labels added for the new opcodes so the harness can assert the
  exchange.
- Core parity close: run the targeted Rust/eMuleBB reask proof from `RUST-CI-002`
  after current HEAD evidence is regenerated.

## Notes

- Provenance: protocol-divergence audit across `emulebb-community-baseline`,
  `emulebb-main`, and emulebb-rust; gap confirmed identical in
  `p2p-overlord-agents`.
- Related design: [`docs/design/udp-source-reask.md`](../../design/udp-source-reask.md),
  [`docs/design/source-management-and-a4af.md`](../../design/source-management-and-a4af.md).
- Depends on nothing else; A4AF is independent.
