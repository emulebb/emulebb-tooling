# RUST-REF-002 - Release parity sweep with full disposition

## Summary

Run one more full-depth parity review of emulebb-rust vs emulebb-mfc master
before the `rust-v0.1.0-beta.1` release, using the proven 3-lane pattern
(Kad / eD2K transfer+protocol / server+REST+persistence), scoped to
**unregistered divergences only**: the omissions registry
(`policy/rust-client-omissions.toml`) and the `[review_reporting]` excluded
list suppress known/intentional surface.

## Why This Matters

The A1–A4 gap list came from the 2026-07-02 review, and one of its claims (A2
outbound leg) was already stale by then. The release claim "parity gaps closed,
excluded surface documented with no ambiguity" needs a fresh enumeration after
the RUST-FEAT-025/030/031/032 fixes land.

## Disposition Rule (no ambiguity allowed)

Every finding gets exactly one disposition:

1. **Fix** — real gap on supported surface: sequential fix lane, one coherent
   commit, MFC-pinned semantics + tests; or
2. **Register** — intentional divergence: entry in
   `policy/rust-client-omissions.toml` with stock/rust/reason/compatibility; or
3. **Defer** — parked surface: named in the deferred list of the release scope
   doc (RUST-FEAT-033) with the parking decision referenced.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] 3-lane review executed against current MFC master after Phase 1/2 fixes.
- [x] Zero findings without a disposition — all 13 fixed/registered/deferred
      (P-1 Kad fix + P-2 OP_SERVERLIST pref landed; P-4 registered 5 omissions;
      P-5/P-6 deferred items recorded in RELEASE-SCOPE.md).
- [x] Review verdict + finding table recorded in this item (not only in
      git-excluded working notes).

## Verdict (2026-07-05)

Full three-lane review recorded in
[`docs/active/PARITY-REVIEW-2026-07-05.md`](../PARITY-REVIEW-2026-07-05.md).
Rust is an oracle-faithful port **at wire parity** across Kad / eD2K transfer /
server / REST / persistence; **no blocker-class divergence**; FEAT-025 verified
conformant. 13 unregistered divergences dispositioned:

- **FIX (2):** Kad `KADEMLIA2_RES` must filter unverified contacts
  (`IsIpVerified`); server obfuscation ports/flags must persist across restart.
- **FIX-comment + REGISTER (1):** OP_SERVERLIST auto-add (misleading pref
  comment; register the always-on behavior).
- **REGISTER-as-omission (4):** kad-flood-lan-exemption,
  upload-slow-cooldown-suppression, upload-duplicate-queued-intra-packet,
  ed2k-partial-file-preview.
- **DEFER (6):** OP_OutOfPartReqs quarantine / upload-admission cooldowns /
  queue-rank-flood ban (all → [[emulebb-rust-defensive-measures-plan]] Phases
  D/E/C-rem); Kad index ceilings, network-size-estimate constants, DoneBlocks
  128-bound (memory-safety/stat cosmetics → RELEASE-SCOPE deferred list).

Execution plan (P-1..P-6, land each on main gate-green, then gate to live tests)
is in the review doc. This item closes when P-1..P-6 land and zero findings are
undispositioned.

## Notes

Local-only workflow: this is an internal evidence gate, not public product
surface.
